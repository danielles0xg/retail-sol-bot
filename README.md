Question 1: API Integration with Fault Tolerance

You need to integrate with Jupiter's swap API for price quotes, but it occasionally routes through illiquid pools or returns errors during high volatility. Write pseudocode to show the code structure: service classes, interfaces, error handling, and how you'd organize the retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and circuit-breakers. How would you handle partial failures and ensure users get valid quotes within 2 seconds? 

Question 2: API Integration Strategy 

The team wants to integrate with a new DEX that just launched. They need price quotes and trade execution within 1 week. Break down your approach: API analysis, integration planning, testing strategy, and rollout plan. 

Question 3: Distributed Caching Architecture

 You have endpoints that aggregate data from multiple sources (portfolio value, P&L calculations, etc.). These are expensive to compute but frequently requested. How would you implement caching that works across multiple server instances and can be effectively utilised throughout the codebase? Write pseudocode showing your caching service structure, how it would be used, cache key management, and invalidation patterns. 

Question 4: WebSocket Load Testing Strategy

You need to test our WebSocket infrastructure under load. Describe your approach to simulating 10,000 concurrent connections, measuring message latency, and identifying bottlenecks. What tools would you use, and how would you structure the load tests to mirror real usage patterns? Show the structure of your load testing code, how you'd organize different test scenarios, and the monitoring/reporting components. 

Question 5: Production Incident Response

It's 2 AM and users report that balance updates are delayed by 30+ seconds. Walk me through your incident response process. What would you check first, how would you identify the root cause, and what temporary fixes might you implement? Describe your debugging approach and show pseudocode for any diagnostic tools, monitoring queries, or temporary fixes you'd implement.
